# steeper

steeper.rb is a command-line script that I wrote as a stopwatch of sorts, for brewing tea at work (in the office). The main problem was keeping track of the changing times tea requires depending on whether or not it has been steeped (for this serving) and the type of tea. It (will) support multiple brews per serving, configuration of brew times, and a complete set of reasonable defaults for common teas (culled from the interwebs).
